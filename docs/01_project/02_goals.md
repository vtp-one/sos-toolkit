# Current Goals
1. Define what is a Digital Intelligence System
    - What are the components
    - How do the components work together
    - What are the blocking components for distributing systems
    - How do users interact with systems


2. Build a command line tool to develop, package, and distribute Digital Intelligence Systems
    - What actions are needed for a development workflow
    - How are these actions different from traditional development
    - What is the best way to package systems
    - What options do we have to detect and mitigate distribution errors


3. Annotate the process to allow Digital Intelligence to use the tools
    - What is the best format for annotation and documentations
    - What information needs to be annotated versus documented
    - How can we translate this information between human readable and machine readable formats
    - How can we use digital intelligence to generate and improve the information


4. How do we make Digital Intelligence input/output interfaces?
    - What can SOS-Toolkit do?
    - What can't SOS-Toolkit do?
    - What components for Digital Intelligence can it not accommodate?
    - Do we have the capabilities to accommodate entirely new concepts?
