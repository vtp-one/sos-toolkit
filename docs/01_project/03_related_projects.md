# VTP.ONE
All the different projects are part of VTP.ONE. 

VTP stands for Viral Thought Project - and this name is intended to be the guiding philosophy. 

Thinking is contagious. 

That thought isn't limited to analog intelligence. 
Both digital and analog intelligence have the capability to inspire each other to create new thoughts, and we need as much thinking as we can find. 


Why the ONE? Because the web-address for the three letter VTP.ONE hostname was cheap. 
Besides frugality, it works with a few other concepts that are currently being developed in the background.


# VTP.OHM
OHM is our target goal for hardware. 
Based in the Jetson ecosystem, it will be a stand-alone system that can function as a desktop server for digital intelligence. 
Once we are able to demonstrate the demand for the hardware, we will be able to focus on the technical specifications.
As the software evolves, you will be able to use it as your own personal cloud. 
Keep your intelligence local where you want it, and access it remotely wherever you need it.


# VTP.SOS
SOS stands for System of Systems, and in that role it aims to stretch from the lowest level BIOS, across the entire OS stack, and up through software into user interfaces. 
This will require a mixture of already existing systems and new systems we build. 
We can already anticipate some systems that we are going to need to build ourselves, and they will live under the SOS namespace.

- [SOS.LOG]
- [SOS.NET] | [SOS.MDNS] | [SOS.PROXY] | [SOS.GATEWAY]
- [SOS.CERT]
- [SOS.CORE]
- [SOS.REGISTRY]


# VTP.ARC
ARC is the boundary between systems and users. 
It is intended to be a user interface development kit that is designed to interface with the SOS systems and the OHM hardware. 
How that works will depend on the type of interface needed and the components required.

# VTP.SYNTHESIS
Synthesis is a prototype Digital Intelligence System to merge all the parts into something functional. 
Most of the systems and start-ups currently being built are vaporware at best and out-right scams at worst. 
We want to build something that doesn't just sound useful, but has measurable outcomes. 
Synthesis is our idea of what that will be. 

We want it to be an interface that enables anyone to develop Digital Intelligence Systems. 
A specialized developer will be better at more complex systems but there is infinite potential for small, simple tasks to be automated in people's daily lives. 
Having the capability to improve, merge, and scale these small systems into larger systems opens up potential for developers to work with.

Various groups are trying similar tasks in specific narrow fields such as using an LLM to code a web frontend, but the goal of Synthesis is to leverage all the different components VTP is building instead of only targeting a single frontend library. 
By building everything with this goal in mind, we can make something that wouldn't be possible without using the same ground-up development.


# VTP.ZERO
While somewhat non-intuitively named, VTP.ZERO is Phase 2. 

The purpose of VTP.ONE is building a prototype. 
We need to experiment to find what parts of our digital world should be replaced before we start building things that push the boundaries between digital and analog. 

VTP.ZERO is the point when we take what we've built, and work with it to start rebuilding it. 
While it's a somewhat sci-fi notion, we aren't very far from this point. 
If we don't do it well, the consequences will be catastrophic. 

There are countless questions that need to be addressed, and they should not be decided in closed-source boardrooms or their captured legislative committees. 
We need an open and accessible forum that is able to handle these discussions, and we will need to transparently let Digital Intelligence take part. 

Various groups and communities are trying to take this role, but without a system like VTP.ONE backing them, their opinions are pretty much irrelevant compared to trillions of dollars. 
Over the years of open-source development, we have learned numerous valuable lessons to prevent this kind of take-over and control; hopefully we can put it to good use when we need it the most. 

The goal of VTP.ZERO is to create something that can serve this purpose by leveraging the power of VTP.ONE to foster open collaboration to realize the thought of truly transparent, open, and accessible Digital Intelligence.
